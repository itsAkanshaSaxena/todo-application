## Assignment Description:

In this assignment, I have created a Todo List web application with user authentication
features. Users should be able to sign up for an account, log in, and manage their tasks.

## Use cases:

1. User Authentication :
   -> Implement user registration (signup) and login functionality.
   -> Users will be able to sign up with a username and password.
   -> Users will be able to log in with their credentials.
   -> Created user forms for both registration and login.
2. User will be able to :
   -> Add a new task.
   -> Mark it as completed or pending.
   -> Delete a task.
   -> Delete all tasks at a time.
   -> Track number of active available tasks in NavBar.
   -> Edit tasks.
3. Logout :
   -> Implemented a logout button that allows users to log out of their account.
4. Created an intuitive user interface with a clean design for both the authentication and todo list parts of the application.
   Display a list of tasks, each with options to edit, mark as completed, and delete.
5. Error Handling
   -> Provide user-friendly error messages for scenarios such as incorrect login credentials.

## Steps involved and commmands involved

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to todo-application.
3. Install all the dependencies using npm install
4. Start using npm start
